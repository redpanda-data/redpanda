# Get started

## Prebuilt packages

Redpanda Data recommends using the following free, prebuilt stable releases.

### Debian/Ubuntu

```
curl -1sLf \
  'https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' \
  | sudo -E bash

sudo apt-get install redpanda
```

### Fedora/RedHat/Amazon Linux

```
curl -1sLf \
  'https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.rpm.sh' \
  | sudo -E bash

sudo yum install redpanda
```

### macOS

Download the `rpk` [binary here](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases). Docker is required on MacOS.

```
brew install redpanda-data/tap/redpanda && rpk container start
```

### Other Linux environments

To install from a `.tar.gz` archive, download the file and extract it into `/opt/redpanda`.

For amd64:

```
curl -LO \
  https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/raw/names/redpanda-amd64/versions/23.3.6/redpanda-24.2.7-amd64.tar.gz
```

For arm64:

```
curl -LO \
  https://dl.redpanda.com/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/raw/names/redpanda-arm64/versions/23.3.6/redpanda-24.2.7-arm64.tar.gz
```

Replace `24.2.7` with the version you want to download. See [Release Notes](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/releases).

## Build Manually

Redpanda Data uses [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) as the build system. Bazel automatically manages most of the toolchains and third-party dependencies.

We rely on [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) to get the right
version of bazel needed for the build. You can for example install it as follows
and add it to your $PATH (or use one of the other suggested ways from their
repo).

```
wget -O ~/bin/bazel https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/latest/download/bazelisk-linux-amd64 && chmod +x ~/bin/bazel
```

There are a few system libraries and preinstalled tools our build assumes are
available locally. To bootstrap and build redpanda along with all its tests.

```bash
sudo ./bazel/install-deps.sh
bazel build --config=release //...
```

For more build configurations, see `.bazelrc`.

## Release candidate builds

Redpanda Data creates a release candidate (RC) build when we get close to a new release, and we publish it to make new features available for testing.
RC builds are not recommended for production use.

### RC releases on Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
curl -1sLf \
  'https://dl.redpanda.com/E4xN1tVe3Xy60GTx/redpanda-unstable/setup.deb.sh' \
  | sudo -E bash

sudo apt-get install redpanda
```

### RC releases on Fedora/RedHat/Amazon Linux

```bash
curl -1sLf \
  'https://dl.redpanda.com/E4xN1tVe3Xy60GTx/redpanda-unstable/setup.rpm.sh' \
  | sudo -E bash

sudo yum install redpanda
```

### RC releases on Docker

Example with `v23.1.1-rc1`:

```bash
docker pull docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/redpanda-unstable:v23.1.1-rc1
```
