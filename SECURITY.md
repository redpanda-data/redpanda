# Security Policy

Official Redpanda Security Policy can be found on [redpanda.com/security](https://redpanda.com/security)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

As with any complex system, it is certain that bugs will be found, some of them security-relevant. If you find a security bug please report it privately via email to [security@redpanda.com](mailto:security@redpanda.com). We will fix the issue as soon as possible and coordinate a release date with you. You will be able to choose if you want public acknowledgement of your effort and if you want to be mentioned by name.

## Public Disclosure Timing

The public disclosure date is agreed between the Redpanda Team and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible, but only after a mitigation or fix is available. We will ask for delay if the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood or the solution is not tested to our standards yet. While there is no fixed time frame for fix & disclosure, we will try our best to be quick and do not expect to need the usual 90 days most companies ask or. For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days.
