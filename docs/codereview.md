# Review guidelines

**LGTM**: stands for Looks Good To Me - This means that you approve the pull request.

1. By default, all code review comments are request for changes. 
  This means the change is blocked until the comment is addressed
2. use `nit: foo` if it is a comment you would like to see change but it is not blocking merge
3. Use `discussion:` if you need more more context before asking the reviewer to 
  make a change.
