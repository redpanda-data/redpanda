# Identity

This is a live document. We should evolve this with time.

These are the values we hope to live by. They will be at times
in conflict with one another, especially if taken to the extreme.
In difficult times, these values help us course correct and steer us
in the direction of the company we feel proud to be part of.

1. Focus. This is our superpower. At large it usually means being able to say 
   no to most ideas, ventures, business opportunities to _win_
   on the very few that we do decide to do.

2. Curiosity. As a company we want to protect the time it takes to be curious. 
   Not all ideas will be immediately useful, but this is how we move forward, 
   and where, collectively, our real discoveries will come from. 
   
3. Empathy. We are a remote-first company. How we say things has
   an outsized impact in writing, the bandwidth of the face-to-face
   has to be compensated by a friendlier tone than you'd normally use.
   This includes codereviews, design documents, chat, etc.

4. Rigor. Our systems need to be correct above all.
   The nature of the problems we tackle means that our code will
   live for decades in production, for missions critical products.


These 4 values stand to provide us with balance, we must stay focused and build a product
users love without sacrificing curiosity. We must have correct systems but not at the expense
of treating each other poorly.
