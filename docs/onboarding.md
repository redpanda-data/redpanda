## Background reading

Quick introduction to logs and Kafka.

1. https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying
2. https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#introduction
3. https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#uses
4. (stretch goal) https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#design

Vectorized is building a _Kafka API_-compatible system (Red Panda) to address
limitations in the Kafka implementation related to performance, manageability,
and safety.

1. Performance
   * Issues surrounding the JVM and GC
   * Outdated server design for modern hardware

2. Safety
   * https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-500%3A+Replace+ZooKeeper+with+a+Self-Managed+Metadata+Quorum

3. Manageability
   * https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#operations
   * Running a system doesn't need to be this complex

Some of the technologies Vectorized is using do this:

1. [Seastar](http://seastar.io/) (and the amazing [Seastar tutorial](https://github.com/scylladb/seastar/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md))
2. [Raft consensus](https://raft.github.io/)

All of the Red Panda (and other) design documents related to Vectorized software
can be found in the shared folder:
