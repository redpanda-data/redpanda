## Contributing

Please keep the [issue tracker](http://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues) limited to **bug reports**, **feature requests** and **pull requests**.


### Personal Support
If you have personal support or setup questions the best place to ask those are [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/reveal.js).


### Bug Reports
When reporting a bug make sure to include information about which browser and operating system you are on as well as the necessary steps to reproduce the issue. If possible please include a link to a sample presentation where the bug can be tested.


### Pull Requests
- Should follow the coding style of the file you work in, most importantly:
  - Tabs to indent
  - Single-quoted strings
- Should be made towards the **dev branch**
- Should be submitted from a feature/topic branch (not your master)


### Plugins
Please do not submit plugins as pull requests. They should be maintained in their own separate repository. More information here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugin-Guidelines
