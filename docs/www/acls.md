# Authorization & authentication

Security should be at the heart of the design of any software project, and Redpanda is not an exception. Today, I wanna introduce the different built-in mechanisms by which you will be able to make your Redpanda cluster more secure. By following this guide, you will familiarize yourself with the available authorization and authentication methods that Redpanda support, both at a conceptual level and at a technical level through hands-on examples.

**A note on scope:** Let's emphasize the word _built-in_ in the previous paragraph. Security is a goal achieved through many different aspects, such as network configuration, organization-wide roles management, among many others. However, they are external to Redpanda so this guide will not cover them.

All the concepts described here are compatible with the current version of Kafka® and its client libraries and CLIs.  

## Prerequisites

- A running redpanda node.

If you haven't checked them out, you can follow our [Getting Started guides](https://vectorized.io/docs/), where you'll find how to get started with Redpanda.

- TLS certificates.

If you have your own certificates, either self-signed or issued by a trusted Certificate Authority, you can use them for this guide. Otherwise, feel free to generate them using [this script](https://gist.github.com/0x5d/56422a0c447e58d8ccbfa0ce1fd6bac6).

## Authentication

### Mutual TLS (mTLS)

Mutual TLS, or 2-way TLS, is an authentication method in which the server keeps a set of trusted certificates in the form of a "truststore" file, and all clients attempting to establish a connection must present their certificate.

To enable it, set the `require_client_auth` field to `true` in the required listener's configuration. For example, to enable mTLS for the "external" API listener:

```yaml
redpanda:

  kafka_api:
  # The listener declaration. `name` can have any value.
  - name: internal
    address: <private IP>
    port: 9092

  advertised_kafka_api:
  # The advertised listeners. `name` should match the name of a declared listener.
  - name: internal
    address: localhost
    port: 9092

  kafka_api_tls:
  # The listener's TLS config. `name` must match the corresponding listener's name.
  - name: internal
    enabled: true
    require_client_auth: true # <- This needs to be enabled!
    cert_file: <path to PEM-formatted cert file>
    key_file: <path to PEM-formatted key file>
    truststore_file: <path to PEM-formatted truststore file>
```

On `rpk`'s side, you can use the `--tls-key`, `--tls-cert` and `--tls-truststore` flags to have it authenticate and establish a TLS connection:

```cmd
$ rpk topic create test-topic \
  --tls-key <path to PEM-formatted key file> \
  --tls-cert <path to PEM-formatted cert file> \
  --tls-truststore <path to PEM-formatted truststore file>

Created topic 'test-topic'.
You may check its config with

rpk topic describe 'test-topic'
```

> `rpk` defaults to connecting to `localhost:9092`. If you're connecting to a remote broker, you will need to pass `--brokers <node IP>:<kafka API port>`

> For an in-depth guide about enabling TLS and mutual TLS in redpanda check out [our guide on the subject](https://vectorized.io/blog/tls-config/).

### SASL/ SCRAM

Redpanda also supports client authentication via SASL/SCRAM (that is, the Simple Authentication and Security Layer protocol, using the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism), which is based on usernames & passwords.

To enable it, set `redpanda.enable_sasl` to `true` in the configuration file, as well as list at least one "superuser" which after created will have permissions for all operations on the clusters.

```yaml
redpanda
  
  enable_sasl: true
  superusers:
  - admin
  # The rest of the config...
```

Then, set a password for the user by running the following command. Replace `<password>` for a password of your choice. 

```cmd
$ rpk acl user create \
  --new-username admin \
  --new-password <password> \
  --api-urls localhost:9644

Created user 'admin'
```

Refer to the next section, _Managing users_, for more details on `rpk acl user`.

You're now able to use the created identity to interact with the Kafka API. For example:

> **Note**: If you still have the TLS config from the previous section, you'll also need to pass the TLS flags.

```cmd
$ rpk topic describe test-topic \
  --user admin \
  --password <password> \
  --sasl-mechanism SCRAM-SHA-256 \
  --brokers localhost:9092

  Name                test-topic  
  Internal            false       
  Cleanup policy      delete      
  Config:             
  Name                Value       Read-only  Sensitive  
  partition_count     1           false      false      
  replication_factor  1           false      false      
  cleanup.policy      delete      false      false      
  Partitions          1 - 1 out of 1  
  Partition           Leader          Replicas   In-Sync Replicas  High Watermark  
  0                   1               [1]        [1]               0               
```

#### Managing users

While having a superuser is a must to get started, it's not really a good idea to either share the superuser's credentials everywhere or to make everyone a superuser.

You can create, delete and list users with `rpk acl user`.

**Creating a user**

```cmd
$ rpk acl user create \
  --new-username Jack \
  --new-password <password> \
  --api-urls <comma-separated URLs of the nodes' admin APIs>

Created user 'Jack'
```

**Deleting a user**

```cmd
$ rpk acl user delete \
  --delete-username Jack \
  --api-urls <comma-separated URLs of the nodes' admin APIs>

Deleted user 'Jack'
```

**Listing users**

```cmd
$ rpk acl user list \
  --api-urls <comma-separated URLs of the nodes' admin APIs>

  USERNAME                        
                                  
  Michael                         
  Jim                             
  Pam                             
  Dwight                          
  Kelly  
```

## Authorization

While **authentication** is about making sure that whatever client connects to your cluster is trusted — or, to put it in other words, who they say they are —, **authorization** is about making sure that each client has access to exactly the data it should.

ACLs is the main mechanism supported by Redpanda to manage user permissions.

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

At a high level, ACLs specify what users can or cannot do. They can be managed with rpk, which supports creating, deleting or listing ACLs through `rpk acl create`, `rpk acl delete` and `rpk acl list`, respectively.

In ACL terminology, the entities accessing the **resources** are called "**principals**". "User" and "Group" (as in "consumer group") are 2 different types of principals.

Principals are allowed or denied access to resources, and you can also specify from which **hosts** they will be allowed or denied access.

This "access" is represented as "**operations**", such as "read", "write", or "describe", and said operations can be performed on **resources**, such as a topic. You can further filter the resources by name, 

Here's a reference of all the concepts and their supported values.

#### **Permissions**

`any`, `allow`, `deny`.

#### **Operations**

`any`, `all`, `read`, `write`, `create`, `delete`, `alter`, `describe`, `clusteraction`, `describeconfigs`, `alterconfigs`, `idempotentwrite`.

#### **Resources**

`*`, `cluster`, `group`, `topic`, `transactionalid`.

#### **rpk acl quick reference**

Please note that you may have to add the `--tls-key`, `--tls-cert` and `--tls-truststore` flags, as well as `--user`, `--password` & `--sasl-mechanism` if mTLS and SASL/ SCRAM are enabled (recommended). They are ommitted here for brevity.

**Creating ACLs**

- Create an ACL allowing a user to perform all operations from all hosts to a topic named "pings":

```cmd
$ rpk acl create \
  --allow-principal 'User:Charlie' \
  --allow-hosts '*' \
  --operation all \
  --resource topic \
  --resource-name pings

Created ACL for principal 'User:Charlie' with host '*', operation 'All' and permission 'Allow'
```

- Create an ACL to deny all users to alter the "cluster" resource from 2 hosts:

```cmd
$ rpk acl create \
  --deny-principal 'User:*' \
  --deny-host 192.168.98.74,10.235.78.12 \
  --operation alter \
  --resource cluster

Created ACL for principal 'User:*' with host '10.235.78.12', operation 'Alter' and permission 'Deny'
Created ACL for principal 'User:*' with host '192.168.98.74', operation 'Alter' and permission 'Deny'
```

As you can see, a single command may result in multiple ACLs being created. You an also create ACLs denying and allowing principals access:

```cmd
$ rpk acl create \
--resource cluster \
--allow-host 168.72.98.52 \
--deny-host 169.78.31.9 \
--deny-principal 'User:david' \
--allow-principal 'User:Alex' \
--allow-principal 'User:Ben' 

Created ACL for principal 'User:david' with host '169.78.31.9', operation 'All' and permission 'Deny'
Created ACL for principal 'User:Alex' with host '168.72.98.52', operation 'All' and permission 'Allow'
Created ACL for principal 'User:Ben' with host '168.72.98.52', operation 'All' and permission 'Allow'
```

**Listing ACLs**

`rpk acl list` allows you to list and filter existing ACLs.

- List all ACLs:

```cmd
$ rpk acl list

  PRINCIPAL     HOST           OPERATION  PERMISSION TYPE  RESOURCE TYPE  RESOURCE NAME  
                
  User:Charlie  *              All        Allow            Topic          pings          
  User:*        192.168.98.74  Alter      Deny             Cluster        kafka-cluster  
  User:david    169.78.31.9    All        Deny             Cluster        kafka-cluster  
  User:Ben      168.72.98.52   All        Allow            Cluster        kafka-cluster  
  User:*        10.235.78.12   Alter      Deny             Cluster        kafka-cluster  
  User:Alex     168.72.98.52   All        Allow            Cluster        kafka-cluster 
```

- List all ACLs for a specific principal:

```cmd
$ rpk acl list --principal 'User:Ben'

  PRINCIPAL  HOST          OPERATION  PERMISSION TYPE  RESOURCE TYPE  RESOURCE NAME  
             
  User:Ben   168.72.98.52  All        Allow            Cluster        kafka-cluster  
```

- List all ACLs that deny principals to alter a resource:

```cmd
$ rpk acl list \
  --permission deny \
  --operation alter

  PRINCIPAL  HOST           OPERATION  PERMISSION TYPE  RESOURCE TYPE  RESOURCE NAME  
             
  User:*     192.168.98.74  Alter      Deny             Cluster        kafka-cluster  
  User:*     10.235.78.12   Alter      Deny             Cluster        kafka-cluster
```

**Deleting ACLs**

`rpk acl delete` allows you to delete ACLs. It's important to note, however, that wildcard values such as `any` for operations and permissions, as well as `*` for hosts and resources may result in the deletion filters matching more than one ACL.

- Delete all ACLs for a specific user targeting a specific resource:

```cmd
$ rpk acl delete --deny-principal 'User:david' --resource cluster

  DELETED  PRINCIPAL   HOST         OPERATION  PERMISSION TYPE  RESOURCE TYPE  RESOURCE NAME  ERROR MESSAGE  
           
  yes      User:david  169.78.31.9  All        Deny             Cluster        kafka-cluster  None
```

- Delete all ACLs granting a principal permissions to all operations from a host:

```cmd
$ rpk acl delete \
  --allow-principal 'User:Ben' \
  --allow-host 168.72.98.52 \
  --operation all
```
