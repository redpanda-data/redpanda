            incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
            contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall
            terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

        3.  ***License to Third Party Works:*** From time to time

            or indirectly that causes the creation of a topic in the

            such entities) that would offer Redpanda Enterprise Edition

        Works combined or bundled with any products, processes or
        materials not provided by Redpanda Data where the alleged
        infringement relates to such combination, (iii) use of a version

    PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.
