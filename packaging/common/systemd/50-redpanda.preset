# A preset file to enable all redpanda systemd units upon installation
# See https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.preset.html
# Systemd evaluates the preset files in lexicographical order, so this
# file's name should always start with a number less than 99, which
# is usually associated with 99-default-disable.preset, and prevents
# enabling any services after it.
