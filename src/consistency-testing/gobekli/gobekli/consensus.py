# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearizability
#
# Linearizability is a property of a concurrent / distributed system. We say
# that an access to data structure is linearizable if even when operations
# overlap, each operation appears to take place instantaneously.
#
# This means that we can think of a linearizable data structure as if it was
# implemented as a remote single threaded server.
#
# Formally it means that if we were given a log of data access across all
# clients consisting of all opearionts including start (ts), end (te) and the
# results of the operations then for each operation we could choose a moment tx
# (ts <= tx <= te) such that if we sorted all the operations by tx and executed
# them in order then we would observed the same results.
#
# To check linearizability of a register (a remote variable) we should sort the
# write / read events by their start and end time and for each event execute
# a corresponding method (from a single thread).
#
# The algorith is inspired by the "Testing shared memories" by Phillip Gibbons
# and Ephraim Korach
# http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.107.3013
#
# We use write_id to do read-mapping and use compare and set on write_id to
# resolve write-order. Since we require that operations are already sorted the
# complexity falls form O(N ln N) class to O(N) class where N is the length of
# a history. It looks like a shifting of the responsibility but if all
# operations are initiated from the same node they already happen in time so we
# don't need to sort and can check consistency on the fly.
