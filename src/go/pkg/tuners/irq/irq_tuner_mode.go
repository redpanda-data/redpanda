/*
	Modes are ordered from the one that cuts the biggest number of CPUs
	from the compute CPUs' set to the one that takes the smallest ('mq' doesn't
	cut any CPU from the compute set).
	This fact is used when we calculate the 'common quotient' mode out of a
	given set of modes (e.g. default modes of different Tuners) - this would
	be the smallest among the given modes.

	Modes description:
	sq - set all IRQs of a given NIC to CPU0 and configure RPS
		to spreads NAPIs' handling between other CPUs.
	sq_split - divide all IRQs of a given NIC between CPU0 and its HT siblings and configure RPS
		to spreads NAPIs' handling between other CPUs.
	mq - distribute NIC's IRQs among all CPUs instead of binding
		them all to CPU0. In this mode RPS is always enabled to
		spreads NAPIs' handling between all CPUs.
	If there isn't any mode given script will use a default mode:
		- If number of physical CPU cores per Rx HW queue is greater than 4 - use the 'sq-split' mode.
		- Otherwise, if number of hyperthreads per Rx HW queue is greater than 4 - use the 'sq' mode.
		- Otherwise use the 'mq' mode.
