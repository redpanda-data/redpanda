This command reports maintenance status for each node in the cluster. The output
is presented as a table with each row representing a node in the cluster.  The
output can be used to monitor the progress of node draining.

   NODE-ID  DRAINING  FINISHED  ERRORS  PARTITIONS  ELIGIBLE  TRANSFERRING  FAILED
   1        false     false     false   0           0         0             0

Field descriptions:

        NODE-ID: the node ID
       DRAINING: true if the node is actively draining leadership
       FINISHED: leadership draining has completed
         ERRORS: errors have been encountered while draining
     PARTITIONS: number of partitions whose leadership has moved
       ELIGIBLE: number of partitions with leadership eligible to move
   TRANSFERRING: current active number of leadership transfers
         FAILED: number of failed leadership transfers

Notes:

   - When errors are present further information will be available in the logs
     for the corresponding node.

   - Only partitions with more than one replica are eligible for leadership
     transfer.
