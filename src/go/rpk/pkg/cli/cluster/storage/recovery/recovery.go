This command is used to restore topics from the archival bucket, which can be 
useful for disaster recovery or if a topic was accidentally deleted.

To begin the recovery process, use the "recovery start" command. Note that this 
process can take a while to complete, so the command will exit after starting 
it. If you want the command to wait for the process to finish, use the "--wait"
or "-w" flag.

You can check the status of the recovery process with the "recovery status" 
command after it has been started.
