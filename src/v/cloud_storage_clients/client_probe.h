/// \brief Cloud storage client probe

/// \note The goal of this is to measure billable traffic
///       (not yet implemented on the cloud side)
///       and performance related metrics. Since clients
///       reuse net::base_transport, they could potentially
///       use its probe. But this doesn't make much sence
///       since cloud storage clients require different approaches
///       to measuring. For instance, all connections are made to the same
///       endpoint and we don't want to look at every individual
///       http connection here because they can be transient.
///       Approach that RPC package uses will lead to cardinality
///       inflation in prometheous creating a lot of small
///       time-series.
