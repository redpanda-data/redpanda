/**
 * persisted_stm is a base class for building ingestion time (*) state
 * machines. Ingestion time means a state machine doesn't need to
 * replicate a command before start processing which allows to:
 *
 *   - reject commands without wasting resources on replication
 *   - be sure that the state can't be changed between a command
 *     received and its replication finished so we it's possible
 *     to ack commands after they're replicated but before they're
 *     applied
 *
 * How does it work?
 *
 * When persisted_stm becomes a leader it replicates the configuration batch and
 * uses its offset `last_term_start_offset` as a limit, up to which we read
 * and execute the commands. It caches the current raft term, and uses that for
 * conditional replication: In a case when its state becomes stale (a new leader
 * with higher term has been chosen) the conditional replication fails
 * preventing an operation on the stale state.
 *
 * To speed up the catch up process persisted_stm snapshots the state
 * and uses it as a base for replaying the commands.
