/**
 * The script_context is the smallest schedulable unit in the coprocessor
 * framework. One context is created per registered coprocessor script,
 * representing one fiber.
 *
 * Important to note is the level of concurrency provided. Within a
 * script_context there is one fiber for which scheduled asynchronous work is
 * performed in sync, meaning that for each read -> send -> write that occurs
 * within the run loop, those actions will occur in order.
 *
 * Since each script_context has one of these fibers of its own, no one context
 * will wait for work to be finished by another in order to continue making
 * progress. They all operate independently of eachother.
