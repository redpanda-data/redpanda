/**
 * State machine adapter.
 *
 * TODO: the consensus pointer should be set in the constructor once we have
 * managed to fully remove consensus setup from the controller.
 *
 * Usage
 * =====
 *
 * A state machine implementation should inherit from this class:
 *
 *   class kv_store : raft::state_machine {
 *     std::map<std::string, std::string> db;
 *     ss::future<> apply(model::record_batch batch) override {...}
 *   };
 *
 * The state machine should be started after it is ready to receive batches and
 * apply them asynchronously from the apply upcall.
 *
 *     ss::future<> apply(model::record_batch batch) override {
 *       db_update(batch);
 *     }
 *
 * The state machine tracks which batches have been applied. Use the `wait`
 * primitive to wait until a particular log offset has been applied to the state
 * machine.
