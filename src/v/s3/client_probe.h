///       and performance related metrics. Since S3 client
///       reuses the net::base_transport it can potentially
///       use its probe. But this doesn't make much sence
///       since S3 requires different approach in measuring.
///       For instance, all connectoins are made to the same
///       endpoint and we don't want to look at every individual
///       http connection here because they can be transient.
///       Approach that RPC package uses will lead to cardinality
///       inflation in prometheous creating a lot of small
///       time-series.
