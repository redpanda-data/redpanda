 * the entire list.

 * Example usage:
 *
 *   class Foo {
 *     // Note that the listHook member variable needs to be visible
 *     // to the code that defines the intrusive_list instantiation.
 *     // The list hook can be made public, or you can make the other class a

 *   FooList myList;
 *   myList.push_back(*foo);
 *
 * Note that each intrusive_list_hook can only be part of a single list at any
 * given time.  If you need the same object to be stored in two lists at once,
 * you need to use two different intrusive_list_hook member variables.
 *
 * The elements stored in the list must contain an intrusive_list_hook member
 * variable.

 * An intrusive list with const-time size() method.

 * A counted_intrusive_list always uses a safe-link hook.
 * counted_intrusive_list::size() is an O(1) operation. Users of this type
 * of lists need to remove a member from a list by calling one of the
 * methods on the list (e.g., erase(), pop_front(), etc.), rather than
 * calling unlink on the member's list hook. Given references to a
 * list and a member, a constant-time removal operation can be
 * accomplished by list.erase(list.iterator_to(member)). Also, when a
 * member is destroyed, it is NOT automatically removed from the list.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 *   class Foo {
 *     // Note that the listHook member variable needs to be visible
 *     // to the code that defines the counted_intrusive_list instantiation.
