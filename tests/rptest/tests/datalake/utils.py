# For docker we run only s3 tests because azurite doesn't support
# Data Lake Storage Gen2 which seems to be necessary for iceberg catalog and alike.
# gcp also uses S3 as storage type
# Currently we only run tests in ec2 + S3 combination
# as the query engine deployment was tested only in ec2.
# The credential plumbing (IAM roles, credential providers) probably
# needs some fixing in GCP environment before enabling it here, otherwise
# there no fundamental reason it shouldn't work.
