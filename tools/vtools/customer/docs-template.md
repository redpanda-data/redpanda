## Infrastructure setup

As you'll see in the next sections, installing redpanda and configuring it is
quicker and easier than many other distributed queues (it does most of the work
itself!). However, there are some steps you'll need to follow to configure the
infrastructure.

### IO

First, to get the best IO performance, the data directory (`/var/lib/redpanda`,
by default) should reside on an XFS partition in a local NVMe SSD. Networked IO
is strongly discouraged, because the max IOPS are significantly lower.

### Network

Redpanda uses the default ports 33145 (RPC), 9092 (Kafka API), and 9644 (Admin
API), so the firewall should allow inbound traffic on them.

Additionally, every node in a cluster should be able to reach each other over
TCP.

Lastly, there's a periodically-executed service that sends resource usage and
configuration metrics to Vectorized's metrics API. If you'd like to help us
improve redpanda and allow this data to be sent, please allow outbound traffic
to `https://m.rp.vectorized.io`. To learn more about metrics reporting, please
see the **Monitoring** section.

## Installation
To get started with redpanda, first set up the package repository:

For RPM-based Linux distributions:

```
# Set up the repository
curl -s https://{{master_token}}:@packagecloud.io/install/repositories/vectorizedio/v/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash

# Install the redpanda package
sudo yum install -y redpanda
```

For Debian-based distributions:

```
# Set up the repository
curl -s https://{{master_token}}:@packagecloud.io/install/repositories/vectorizedio/v/script.deb.sh | sudo bash

# Install the redpanda package
sudo apt install -y redpanda
```

## Single-Node Quickstart

If you're just trying out redpanda on your personal computer, make sure to turn
on _development_ mode, so that no permanent configuration changes are made to
your OS:

`sudo rpk mode dev`

To make sure redpanda runs as fast as it can, first run the tuner
service, which will autoconfigure your VM to guarantee the best
performance.

```
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner
```

That's it! Now you're ready to run redpanda:

```
sudo systemctl start redpanda
```

You can inspect the logs by running 

```
journalctl -u redpanda
```

## Starting a Redpanda Cluster

> Before following along, make sure you followed the steps described in
> **Installation** on every node.

> All of the concepts and commands used in this guide are described in later
> sections of the documentation. Please refer to them to learn more.

> This guide assumes that you have configured your firewall to allow
> traffic between the nodes. Please see the **Configuration** section for
> reference on which ports should allow inbound traffic.

For each new redpanda cluster, there will be one **root** node (not to be
confused with a leader node). The root node is bootstrapped and then new nodes
can join it to form a cluster.

To start a cluster, pick a node to be the root and use `rpk config bootstrap`
to bootstrap the configuration. For a root node, you only need to set its ID and
the IP it should use for its API (usually its private IP). Each node's ID needs
to be a unique positive integer.

`sudo rpk config bootstrap --id <unique id> --self <ip>`

Then for each node we'd like to join, we just have to set its ID and give it the
root node's address:

> rpk will try to discover a non-loopback IP it can use. However, if the host
> has multiple addresses associated with it, you'll need to pass the --self
> flag so it knows which one to use.

`sudo rpk config bootstrap --id <unique id> --ips <root node ip>`

Once you've run the above command in every non-root node, just run the tuner
and redpanda in each of them:

```
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner
sudo systemctl start redpanda
```

That's it! Your cluster should be up and running. You can check the logs with

`journalctl -f -u redpanda`

## Monitoring

Redpanda exposes a Prometheus metrics endpoint in `/metrics` in port 9644.

Our packages also ship with a systemd service, which executes periodically and
reports resource usage and configuration data to Vectorized's metrics API. It is
enabled by default, and the data is anonymous. If you'd like us to be able to
identify your cluster's data, to be able to monitor it and alert you of possible
issues, please set the `organization` (your company's domain) and `cluster_id`
(usually your team's or project's name) configuration fields. For example:

```
rpk config set organization 'vectorized.io'
rpk config set cluster_id 'metrics'
```

To opt out of all metrics reporting, set `rpk.enable_usage_stats` to `false`:
```
rpk config set rpk.enable_usage_stats false
```

## Redpanda & Rpk
Redpanda has a CLI tool called rpk, the Redpanda Keeper, which is a CLI &
toolbox for redpanda. As a user, you will always interact with it to auto-tune
the OS and hardware settings, start redpanda (when not run as a systemd service)
and edit the configuration.

## Configuration
The redpanda configuration is by default loaded from and persisted to
`/etc/redpanda/redpanda.yaml`.

It is broadly divided into 2 sections, `redpanda` and `rpk`.
 
The `redpanda` section contains all the runtime configuration, such as the cluster
member IPs, the node ID, data direcory, and so on.

The `rpk` section contains configuration related to tuning the machine that redpanda will
run on.

Here's a sample of what the config file looks like.

```yaml
# organization and cluster_id help Vectorized identify your system.
organization: ""
cluster_id: ""
pid_file: "/var/lib/redpanda/pid"

redpanda:
  # The directory where the data will be stored. It must reside on an XFS
  # partition.
  data_directory: "/var/lib/redpanda/data"
  
  # An integer to identify the current node. Must be unique within the cluster.
  node_id: 1
  
  # The inter-node RPC server config.
  rpc_server:
    address: "0.0.0.0"
    port: 33145
  
  # The Kafka API config.
  kafka_api:
    address: "0.0.0.0"
    port: 9092
    
  # A list of `host` objects, holding known nodes' configuration. If empty, the
  # node will be considered a root node and become available upon startup.
  seed_servers:
    - node_id: 1

```

### Well Known IO
`rpk` comes with a command called `iotune` which finds the optimal configuration
for redpanda's IO scheduler, with the current storage device and processor. To
get the most precise results, iotune should usually run for approximately 30
minutes - or 1800 seconds (i.e. `rpk iotune --duration 1800`).

However, rpk ships with a matrix of optimal configurations for the
recommended VM/ storage device type setups on AWS (currently, GCP and Azure VM types
support is coming soon), GCP and Azure. Thanks to this, when running redpanda on the
recommended setups, you can just fire it up with no additional steps.

> It is still recommended to execute `rpk iotune` on custom setups. There's no need
> to run it every time, however: you can run it once for each setup that you
> will use to run a redpanda node, keep the results, and reuse them from there.

Upon statup, rpk will try to detect the current cloud and instance type via the
different vendors' metadata APIs, setting the correct iotune properties if the
detected setup is a supported one.

If access to the metadata API isn't allowed from the instance, you can also hint
the desired setup by passing the `--well-known-io` flag to `rpk start` with the
cloud vendor, VM type and storage type surrounded by quotes and separated by
colons (`:`):

```sh
rpk start --well-known-io 'aws:l3.xlarge:default'
```

It can also be specified in the redpanda YAML configuration file, under the
`rpk` object:

```yaml
rpk:
  well_known_io: 'gcp:c2-standard-16:nvme'
```

> If `well-known-io` is specified in the config file, and as a flag, the value
> passed with the flag will take precedence.

In the case where a certain cloud vendor, machine type or storage type isn't
found, or if the metadata isn't available and no hint is given, `rpk` will
print an error pointing out the issue and **continue** using the default values.

### Rpk Modes
To achieve the best performance possible, redpanda relies on interrupt coalescing, interrupt
distribution, no-op IO scheduling, CPU frequency scaling (performance governor), NIC
multi-queue setup, memory locking and real-time scheduling. However, enabling these features
isn't always the best for a personal computer running multiple processes, each of which are
always competing for memory, CPU and IO.

Because of this, redpanda enables them by default, but allows them to be disabled according to
your needs. To do it easily, you can toggle on redpanda's Developer Mode, which disables these
production settings so that you can still use it in your laptop.

Enabling Developer Mode is as simple as running

```sh
# You may need to run this command as root.
rpk mode developer
```

For runtime settings (that is, settings that are only effective while redpanda is running),
it will conveniently disable any which may affect other processes' performance, by setting the
corresponding fields in the `redpanda.yaml` configuration file to `false`.

For persistent session or system configurations, it will also undo any changes redpanda might
have made in your machine (such as enabling real-time scheduling or disabling certain interrupt
requests for some CPUs).

Likewise, if you'd like to re-enable the default, production settings, just run

```sh
# You may need to run this command as root.
rpk mode production
```

These commands are idempotent, so they're safe to run multiple times.

For runtime settings, you can also review and edit `redpanda.yaml` and enable or disable
any of them. However, if you run `rpk mode` again, it might overwrite any changes you
made in the affected fields.

If you switch modes or change any setting, you have to restart redpanda for the changes
to take place.
